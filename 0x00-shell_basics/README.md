for excecuting a script we add ./<filename>
./filename
it will not work until we give it ex√©cution permission, we can check permissions using ls -l
r: reading
w: writing
x: execution
d: directory
-: file (edited)
to add the execution permission to a file we do
chmod  u+x filename
check if the x is added by typing ls -l
